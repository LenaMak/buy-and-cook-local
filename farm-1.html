   <div class="farm-paragraph">Albert Meier Hof has more than 100 apple trees with lots of different sorts of apples:
    sweet, sour, sweet-sour, whatever you might want when it comes to apples. Albert Meier Hof is a family farm run by
    Albert Meier with the help of his lovely wife and three sons who help a lot.
    No pesticides have been ever used to make soil give more apples. Everything is natural and provides high quality
    products. But you can find there not only apples, but also pears which are delicious themselves and go well with
    apples in apple juice and different jams.Apart from that, you can also find there plums and cherries during the
    summer. As a matter of fact, you always have a choice of fresh local fruit on the farm.
   </div>
   <div class="farm-paragraph">Do we have only fruit? The answer is no. You can also buy young potatoes in spring when
    they just start growing and walnuts in autumn and winter if there are any left by the time winter comes.</div>

   <div class="farm-paragraph">Below you can see our current offers. As soon as we have something new to offer it will
    appear here on our page.</div>
